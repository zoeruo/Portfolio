                        Cheng Hsin General Hospital is a modern general hospital located in Taipei, and it is famous for
                        cardiology.
                        The goal of this project was to build a responsive website featuring the new international
                        medical services and provide more convenient online services for the general public

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>The previous hospital website was built almost ten years ago. Since the hospital's services had expanded, the
            old website could no longer support the vast information. For example, the newly established International
            Medical Services Center required a multi-language website for international patients. Moreover, it was
            highly inconvenient to departments that they couldn't edit their information anytime on the old website
            because it was outsourced. The project includes four websites: The Official Website, a Multi-Language
            Website, Departments Websites, and a Content Management System.</p>
        <p>I was the sole designer alongside one system analyst and three web developers in the initial stage of the
            project. I was the only one left completing the remaining codes and maintaining the website in the late
            stage. My key achievements are listed as below:</p>
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-square">
            <li>Integrated the needs of various departments.</li>
            <li>Executed from design to web development.</li>
            <li>Improved usability according to feedbacks from users solely.</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>The Official Website</h4>
            <p>After understanding the old website's structure, I added components and categorized the information.
                For
                instance, people can find common services under the Health Information section.  In addition, I
                canceled
                the subscription function since no more than a hundred people were still subscribing. Instead, I
                added a
                section for the general public to download the newsletters.</p>

        <div class="uk-padding">
            <h4>Multi-Language Website</h4>
            <p>The international website was designed to provide simpler but useful and clear information. As for
                the
                Leading Specialties, editors have two options for adding content. One is to select articles from the
                departments' websites, which departments' members edited, and insert them into the section; the
                other is
                to insert brand new articles. </p>

        <div class="uk-padding">
            <h4>Departments Websites</h4>
            <p>About is the homepage of the website. The eight sections below are the functions the website
                provides.
                Every department can choose to add or remove the sections. For example, editors can remove the
                Events
                link from the menu if a department doesn't want to include event information or doesn't even hold
                events.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="uk-padding">
            <h4>Content Management Website</h4>
            <p>The website includes content management and authority management function. By defining each role's
                access
                to the website’s contents and assigning roles to accounts, employees in the hospital can log in to
                the
                system and edit the parts they are responsible for.</p>

        <p>High-fidelity Prototyping allowed me to discuss the details and styling of content on different screen sizes
            with the deputy superintendent. Based on the hospital's logo, which contains an orchid with a tenet meant to
            serve the public with charity, I opted for a warm look to convey the aim to the general public.</p>

                language on a page with no corresponding language, the user will be redirected to the previous page.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>Our team used .NET to build the four websites. As soon as I confirmed the design, I started to develop the
            websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Other engineers started from the back-end codes. The schedule was
            intense. Due to the time limit, we were developing and testing simultaneously. When the project was about
            80% to completion, my teammates withdrew from the project to work on other systems. I finished the websites
            and published them on my own. In the development process, I received feedback directly and improved the
            functions at every stage by collecting their demands.</p>

        <p>Since implementing the new responsive website, we have seen a significant increase in online appointments and
            international patients. In addition, I have received positive feedback from the users about the concise and
            straightforward functions, allowing them to show people their features and saving them a large proportion of
            their time.</p>
