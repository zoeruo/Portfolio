                    <p>
                        We believe that people’s recognition of a city can form a consciousness. It forges a balanced
                        impression of the city, Taipei. We made the audience log out of their status temporarily and
                        examine the identity toward their daily life all over again in a new status.
                    </p>
                    <p>Undefined Senses involved 12 participants per play. By the intervention of messages, sounds,
                        videos, and other new media forms, the audience members were separated from their normal status
                        and then re-entered the city. The audience experienced a 120 minutes action, passing through or
                        staying in different city areas. </p>
                    <p>Undefined Senses was divided into five sections with an intermission. Every participant got a
                        cellphone in the beginning and was guided by a customer service named Emily. Participants could
                        also communicate with Emily through earphones.</p>

        <h3>Part2&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>What audience members did</span></h3>
        <p>Part2 took place when the audience members entered Huashan 1914 Creative Park. They started to receive
            messages from the guides and connect with them for the first time. Sometimes they could only select an
            answer from multiple options, and sometimes they got a chance to type in anything they wanted to ask. Twelve
            audience members started their adventures from different places. The following picture shows the twelve
            routes. At last, they were led to the same platform to begin Part3.</p>

        <p>
            The audience members had to accomplish specific behavior to get the next instruction.</p>

        <p>
            UI Design for the mobile phones held by audience members. We wanted to convey a sense of confusion between
            the virtual world and reality through these text messaging interfaces.</p>

        <h3>Part2&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>What the guides did</span></h3>
        <p>The guides watched the audience members through cameras and messaged the audience members through the
            application we built in the control center. Every guide observed the audience member they were guiding and
            decided to send the default or custom questions. They had to focus on the conversation and be aware of the
            schedule simultaneously to lead the audience member to the platform on time.</p>

        <h3>Part2&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Interactive Installations</span></h3>
        <p>The original idea was that it flashes when the audience member gets close enough to the installation. I built
            a Beacon with Raspberry Pi, designed the model, and created it with 3D printing technology. I successfully
            made the installation. Nevertheless, we replaced the Beacon with other simpler but more effective
            interactions and left the Beacon as a surprise in the user testing phase. I gave priority to audiences’
            experience over the commitment I made to conquer technical barriers.</p>

            <h4>Put audiences' experience first</h4>
            <p>Due to the various physical conditions, few audience members felt uncomfortable during the action. For
                instance, even if we knew that VR would cause dizziness to some people, we didn't consider this
                potential problem at first. Not until I heard a scream caused by dizziness during the performance did I
                realize we missed a crucial factor to creating a fascinating experience for the users. After adding
                minor procedures to the following shows, the presentation went without a hitch, and the audience members
                were able to enjoy the show.</p>

            <h4>Good teamwork facilitates creativity and productivity</h4>
            <p>In the brainstorming process, nine team members discussed closely to foster ideas. We held discussions in
                several places, which effectively brought new thoughts and atmosphere into our team. After the concept
                was confirmed, we divided into two groups. While some members were working on the contents of the
                messages and events, some members were researching tools to build applications. Each of us followed our
                timeline, so we cooperated very well. Moreover, when problems occurred, we flocked together to find
                solutions. The motivated team brought the presentation to success.</p>
