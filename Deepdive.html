            <h4>The Official Website</h4>
            <p>After understanding the old website's structure, I added components and categorized the information.
                For
                instance, people can find common services under the Health Information section.  In addition, I
                canceled
                the subscription function since no more than a hundred people were still subscribing. Instead, I
                added a
                section for the general public to download the newsletters.</p>

            <h4>Multi-Language Website</h4>
            <p>The international website was designed to provide simpler but useful and clear information. As for
                the
                Leading Specialties, editors have two options for adding content. One is to select articles from the
                departments' websites, which departments' members edited, and insert them into the section; the
                other is
                to insert brand new articles. </p>

            <p>About is the homepage of the website. The eight sections below are the functions the website
                provides.
                Every department can choose to add or remove the sections. For example, editors can remove the
                Events
                link from the menu if a department doesn't want to include event information or doesn't even hold
                events.</p>

                to the website’s contents and assigning roles to accounts, employees in the hospital can log in to

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>Our team used .NET to build the four websites. As soon as I confirmed the design, I started to develop the
            websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Other engineers started from the back-end codes. The schedule was
            intense. Due to the time limit, we were developing and testing simultaneously. When the project was about
            80% to completion, my teammates withdrew from the project to work on other systems. I finished the websites
            and published them on my own. In the development process, I received feedback directly and improved the
            functions at every stage by collecting their demands.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Since implementing the new responsive website, we have seen a significant increase in online appointments and
            international patients. In addition, I have received positive feedback from the users about the concise and
            straightforward functions, allowing them to show people their features and saving them a large proportion of
            their time.</p>
